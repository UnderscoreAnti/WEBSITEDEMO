    <h1><span>About Me</span></h1>
    <p align='center'>
        <b>Honestly</b> I'm more annoyed that I have to learn webdev so I can host
        a website for free.<br />There's no reason for me to do this other than wanting more money.<br />
        I program.<br />C/C++<br />C#<br />Python<br />And after this Javascript.<br /><sub>yikes.</sub>
